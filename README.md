### Info:

 MIDI processing toolchain based around envelopes and controllers.

### Build

##### Dependencies:
* Cantina common (included)

### Todo:

#### Features 

- [ ] Move ownership of MIDI controllers to the envelopes, make a controller manager to dispatch input commands.
- [ ] Change handling of ADSR State velocity from Physics (too unstable) to a simple slider. (obvious in retrospect,
but hey I got to learn some stuff before it turned into a nightmare.)
- [ ] Apply changes to Cantina.
